This will make Adrenaline Shot usable item.
You will need esx_opitonalneeds for this to work.

Inst.
1- First, make sure item name in database and in code are the same.
2- open client/main.lua and copy everything inside, then paste it to the bottom of esx_optionalneeds/client/main.lua
3- do the same thing for server/main.lua

You can change some stuff in client.lua to make adrenaline shot less powerfull or more powerfull
